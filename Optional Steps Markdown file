I've never used GitHub before so I'm learning alot. So far I've looked at the processes for how to create branches, pull requests, and a markdown file. 
All of the vacabulary for the different aspects of GitHub were also new so I've learned about a repository, committing, pushing, pull requests, branches, and forks.
I'm just trying to play around and get familiar with this application. It seems there is alot to learn about it and alot that it is capable of.
There is alot that I'm still confused about for example I practiced the pull request and I'm not sure if I did it correctly.
I also am not sure what was meant by "experiment with different styles" for these markdown files.
I know that I will be less cofused about the application the more I use it and become familiar with its functioning.
